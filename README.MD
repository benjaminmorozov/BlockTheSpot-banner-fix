# BlockTheSpot banner fix

A multi-purpose **adblocker** and **skip-bypass** for the **Windows Spotify desktop application**.
Last tested version: **Spotify for Windows 1.1.81.604.gccacfc8c**

## Important checks before installation:

 - Update Windows, update Spotify and update BlockTheSpot.
 - Make sure, you have the desktop version of Spotify installed, as this is not intended for the Microsoft Store version.

## Installation/Update:

 - Run the BlockTheSpot.bat file.
 - Done!

## How to uninstall:

 - Run the uninstall.bat file.
 - Done!
 or
 - Reinstall Spotify.

## Additional notes:

 - "chrome_elf.dll" gets replaced by the Spotify installer each time it updates, hence why you'll probably
   need to apply the patch again when it happens
 - BlockTheSpot might only works as expected with the last tested version. Please check it before opening an issue.
 - Spicetify users will need to reapply BlockTheSpot after applying a Spicetify patches.
